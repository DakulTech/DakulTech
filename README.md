👋 Hi, I’m @DakulTech — a MERN Full Stack Developer and SaaS Builder.
💻 I specialize in building scalable web applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I'm also proficient with Next.js, and comfortable working with both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases. I leverage the power of AI through effective prompt engineering to enhance development workflows and user experiences.
🌱 My journey into tech began with a deep love for invention and problem-solving, which led me to transition from Agricultural Science—a field focused on food production and rural development—to the dynamic world of Science and Technology. I believe tech empowers us to be inventors, not just users, and in this space, I’ve truly found my calling. 😊❤️
🤝 I’ve worked independently and collaboratively with clients on diverse projects, delivering impactful solutions and clean user experiences.
📬 Feel free to reach out — I’m most active on Twitter and LinkedIn, and always open to connecting, collaborating, or just chatting about tech and innovation. 😉
