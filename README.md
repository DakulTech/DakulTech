- 👋 Hi, I’m @DakulTech
-I'm a Front-end web developer. And my love for invention and problem solving ushered me into the field of tech and quitting my previous discipline in agricultural science which deals with production food and development of rural areas to urban. Science and Technology is an important aspect of our lives which promotes better modes of living by encouraging man to become an inventor not merely a user. In this field, I found what I've always wanted😊❤

-I have experienced working with clients independently and collaboratively in various projects.

-FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT, I'M MOSTLY ACTIVE ON TWITTER AND LINKEDIN😉
